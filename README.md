# Ex4.1-Animal-Feeding-Phase1

## Aim:
To develop a animal feeding game-Phase-1 using unity.

## Algorithm:
Player Control :
Step 1 :
Extract the package and in unity , asserts -> Import packages -> Custom packages and select the package. When we go to Assets folders we can see the course library which we extracted

Step 2 :
If you want, drag a different material from Course Library > Materials onto the Ground object

Step 3 :
Drag 1 Human, 3 Animals, and 1 Food object into the Hierarchy

Step 4 :
Rename the character “Player”, then reposition the animals and food so you can see them

Step 5 :
Adjust the XYZ scale of the food (2,2,2) so you can easily see it from above

Step 6 :
In your Assets folder, create a “Scripts” folder, and a “PlayerController” script inside.Attach the script to the Player by dragging the c# file to the player and open in the inspector and check whether it is attached.

Moving Forward :
Step 1 :
Create a new “MoveForward” script, attach script to the Food Pizza by dragging the c# file to the pizza and open in the inspector and check whether it is attached

Step 2 :
Create a new “Prefabs” folder, drag your food (Pizza) into Prefab folder, and a pop up raises-> choose Original Prefab

Step 3 :
Select the Player in the hierarchy, then drag the pizza from your Prefabs folder onto the new Projectile Prefab box in the inspector

Step 4 :
Rotate all animals on the Y axis by 180 degrees to face down

Step 5 :
Select all three animals in the hierarchy and Add Component > Drag the Move Forward script from the Scripts into inspector

Step 6 :
Edit their speed values and test to see how it looks. Drag all three animals into the Prefabs folder, choosing “Original Prefab”
